  # We use this to compile the shared web worker for the web database. This dependency
  # isn't required for most apps. You only need it if you want to target the web, use
  # web workers for drift AND want to compile those web workers through `build_runner`.
  # Either way, using this package with Flutter requires a delicate setup described in
